SJSU Spring 2021 Masters Project - Interface Drone Autonomy with Simulation and Real World Enivronments

This open-source repo connects several computer vision, satellite surveilence, and reinforcement learning methods for drone autonomoy.

It was built in Python, and can interface with either a DJI Tello drone or Unreal Engine enviornment built with Microsoft Airsim.

Each component of this code is heavily modulated to rotate in/out different models and featuers, 
and can easily be adjusted to connect to any other drone or simulation enviornment.

We have a user interface built with streamlit.io, or the user can dive into the code to make simple edits.

To run streamlit UI, launch from terminal: "streamlit run streamlit_interface.py"
